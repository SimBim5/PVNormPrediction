<h1 align="center">PV NORM PREDICTION</h1>
<p align="center">
</p>

As a part of the project LINDA 2.0, several field test will be performed on low voltage grids composed of rooftop solar plants and housholds. During the last 20 years in Germany, several norms for connection of photovoltaic power plants have been proposed, whose field implementation have been a direct responsibility of the grid operators. This has led to lack of information regarding the norms that each of the connected solar power plants follow and its rated power. To be able to identify each solar power plant inside a low voltage grid, a machine learning algorithm has been developed in this work.

# ☀️🔋⚡ PV Norms  💡🌞🔌

As already mentioned, there are many norms for connection of photovoltaic power plants in germany, proposed over the last 20 years. For our predicitons, we consider the following 4 PV Norms: 

1. Erster Punkt
2. Zweiter Punkt
3. Dritter Punkt
4.
